# Description
In the following, you will meet a series of realistic leadership dilemmas from the daily life in Product Supply. 

For each dilemma you must choose between 3-4 options. If none of the options really match what you would do in real life, please pick the one that you agree the most with.

You will get feedback on your choices when you have completed all dilemmas.

Note that your results will be **saved** if you are not able to complete the dilemmas in one session.

The Competency Compass is your private tool. Nobody will see your results unless you choose to share them.
