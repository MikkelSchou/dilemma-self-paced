# Description
Jens is an experienced technician on your team. He works with the maintenance of production equipment and has been on your team for many years.

He tells you that one of the pumps occasionally crashes, which is very costly, as it puts a temporary hold to the production. Jens has already addressed the problem systematicaly through an A3 and knows the pump typically crashes when it's been operating for too long because the impeller blades break. Jens suggests that he starts to replace the blades more frequently to avoid downtime.

You know that Jens has a very busy schedule, and you are concerned that assigning him more work to replace the blades could lead to delays in his scheduled maintenance work, which would also be costly. 

How do you respond?


# Choice
I thank Jens for his suggestion and initiative to reduce system breakdowns. I ask him to update the maintenance plan for the pump and increase the frequency of impeller blade replacements so we can implement his suggestion as fast as possible.

# Feedback
It's great that you're supportive of Jens' suggestion. Being able to identify and implement process improvements is core to the Novo Nordisk Way. However, you should make sure that the implementation of the new maintenance schedule is planned in a way that doesn't interfere with the current schedule and the working environment for Jens. By giving Jens more work, there is a risk that the workload will become too much for him and some of his other maintenance tasks will get delayed, which also could lead to expensive downtime. 

This is a dilemma between creating time to eliminate waste and simplify processes while also ensuring a healthy work environment. 




# Choice
I thank Jens for his suggestion and initiative but tell him that we need to delegate some of his tasks first. He is simply too busy managing the daily maintenance to also implement the new impeller blade replacement system. Until the delegation is in place, it's better that Jens manages the daily maintenance schedule and fixes the occasional pump replacements if it should occur.

# Feedback
This is a great response. Being able to identify and implement process improvements is core to the Novo Nordisk Way. Therefore, it's great that you consider delegation as a way to make Jens' suggestion work and manage his workload at the same time. With this choice, you are delaying the new process improvement, but in the long run delegating some of Jens' tasks will lead to a more stable production, where Jens is not a bottleneck, fewer breakdowns and faster development of other team members. 

This is a dilemma about accelerating team members development, empower others to take action and building a culture where problems are eliminated at root cause.





# Choice
I thank Jens for his suggestion and encourage him to implement the idea. However, before implementing the new maintenance schedule, I ask him to take the needed time to plan the replacements carefully so they don't interfere  with his regular maintenance work. Once we have a good plan in place, we can initiate the new schedule.

# Feedback
Good choice. Being able to identify and implement process improvements is core to the Novo Nordisk Way. With this choice, you are delaying the new process improvement. However, your focus on planning should ensure that the new process is properly integrated into Jens' current maintenance schedule. This, in turn, will reduce unnecessary disruptions to his regular maintenance work. However, you should consider delegation of some of Jens' tasks. Despite good planning, giving Jens more work could make him an even bigger bottleneck and you could soon find yourself in a similar situation again. Moreover, the workload may also become too much for Jens to handle in the long run.

This is a dilemma about accelerating team members development, empower others to take action and building a culture where problems are eliminated at root cause.
