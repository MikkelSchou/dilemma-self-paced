 - Title: Dilemma 9: Visual Management

# Description
A month ago you were appointed new leader in a team of 10 employees. Before you joined, the team was without a leader for three months due to internal restructuring. 

The team has been responsible for the daily board meetings, but you don't think these meetings are creating as much value as they could. The board's five KPI's have been red for a long time, and there are too many complex action items that never get done.

In response, you decide to focus on visual management in the team.  

How do you do this?

# Choice
I want to get to know the team even better before I implement any changes to the team's processes. I decide to spend  more time getting to know the team and its processes, and if the problem persists I'll come up with an improvement plan later.

# Variables

- rolemodel-setdirection-new: 0.1
- rolemodel-setdirection-new-2_2: 0.2
- rolemodel-driveoutcome-new-1_3: 0.9
- rolemodel-driveoutcome-new-1_4: 0.1

# Feedback
It's great that you want to get to know your team better before deciding whether it's relevant to change the design of the performance board. However, as the KPI's are red, you don't know whether the status reflects important challenges that need to be addressed soon. 

This is a dilemma of building teams and ensuring an inclusive work environment while also setting direction and driving outcomes.




# Choice
It's time for me to take a more active role in the daily board meetings. Going forward, I will lead the meetings and set a more clear direction for the team by demonstrating how KPI's and action items can be reached more effectively.

# Feedback
It's very good that you take action and prioritise to lead the performance board meetings. Keep in mind that for a performance board to be truly effective it should be backed up by all team members. By choosing this approach you could risk that you don't have the team's full support to your changes.

# Choice
I invite the team for a collaborative workshop where we can define new KPIs that are more relevant and realistic for the team.

# Feedback
Great choice. You choose to do something about the issue of low value from the performance board meetings as well as the red KPI's. A workshop that ensures buy-in from team members could be a good starting point. Remember that you are responsible for ensuring that the outcome is in line with the overall organisational priorities.
