 - Title: Dilemma 4: Integrating a foreign team member into your team

 - Next: dilemma5

# Description
Olga was recruited to your team from Russia three months ago. She has a highly specialised profile that is needed in your team. 

When Olga joined the team, you asked everyone to make English the common language in the team.

However, you're noticing that this doesn't always happen. In fact, everyone besides Olga speaks Danish most of the time, as it turns out they don't feel comfortable expressing themselves in English. Meanwhile, Olga is beginning to come in late to work, skips social gatherings and she doesn't come for coffee breaks with the rest of the team.

What do you do?

# Choice
I understand that my Danish team members are not comfortable speaking English all the time. Therefore, I tell them that going forward everyone will have to communicate in English only during team meetings, in shared emails and conversations that Olga participates in. When Olga is not involved, they are free to communicate in the language they prefer.

# Feedback

This is a great choice which signals that you are committed to creating a truly collaborative team. You're probably right that your Danish team members might not be happy with this decision in the short term, but as they adjust to speaking a new language they will eventually.  

This is a dilemma of balancing the emotions of others on the one hand, and creating a healthy and inclusive  (collaborative) work environment on the other.




# Choice
I worry that forcing my Danish team members to speak English will have a negative influence on the team spirit and make them participate less in shared discussions. Instead, I try to set a good example myself by always speaking English. But, I allow my Danish team members to decide for themselves which language they communicate in. Over time I am sure they will all feel more comfortable speaking to each other in English.

# Feedback
It's a good reflection that it might have a negative influence on the team if you force them to speak English. However, if you let your team choose what language they speak, you are not addressing the root cause of the problem. In this scenario, your Danish team members will likely continue to speak Danish and Olga will feel increasingly left out. 

This is a dilemma of balancing the emotions of others on the one hand, and creating a healthy and inclusive work environment on the other.





# Choice
The only way to include Olga in the team is to make all team members speak English, although my Danish team members might not be happy with this decision. If I make English optional or dependent on Olga's presence, my Danish team members are likely to avoid Olga altogether. I contact HR to get support in making this happen in the best way possible. I am convinced that this is in the long term interest of my team's wellbeing.

This is a great choice which signals that you are committed to creating a truly collaborative team. You're probably right that your Danish team members might not be happy with this decision in the short term. But as they adjust to speaking a new language, it will eventually benefit the whole team, including Olga, who is an important member of your team.   

This is a dilemma of balancing the emotions of others on the one hand, and creating a healthy and inclusive work environment on the other.
