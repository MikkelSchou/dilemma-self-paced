# Description
Daniel has been working on your team for four months, and several of your employees have flagged serious concerns over his performance. They've complained that his attention to detail is very low which has led to extra work for them because they now have to check all of his outputs. 

You used to work with Daniel in a different team years ago, and you have a great impression of his skills and personality. This makes you wonder whether your employees' complaints are truly reflective of Daniel's poor performance, or if something else is going on.

How do address your employees' complaints?


# Choice
I know that my own positive experience with Daniel from the past could impact my judgment of him, so I set up a meeting with HR to plan the best way forward. Before I approach Daniel, I need to explore if there could be some underlying reasons why my team members would complain about his performance.

# Feedback
It's great that you're keeping an open mind here. You're absolutely right to consider alternative reasons for your employees' complaints over Daniel's performance. It also makes sense to include HR for initial sparring around how to approach the issue. 

This is a dilemma about being aware of own biases, others' emotions while also providing sincere feedback, developing your team members  and setting direction for your team.


# Choice
I need to get a better understanding of Daniel's overall performance and how Daniel interacts with the team. I plan to talk to Daniel, as well as a few stakeholders outside of my team who have worked with him to get their view on his skills. Once I have covered multiple views on his performance I will better understand if he is performing poorly. If that is the case, I will let him know the areas where I expect to see an improvement moving forward.

# Feedback
It's good that you're keeping an open mind instead of jumping to conclusions and want to consider Daniel's performance more broadly and from different perspectives before you raise the issue of poor performance with Daniel directly. Getting input from other stakeholders is a good way to challenge your own biases as your own positive experience with Daniel from the past may impact your judgment of him and the entire situation

This is a dilemma about being aware of own biases, others' emotions while also providing sincere feedback, developing your team members  and setting direction for your team.




# Choice
Even if Daniel is performing poorly we're all responsible for giving him timely and sincere feedback to point him in the right direction. I therefore have a conversation with Daniel to see how things are going and if he is struggling somewhere. I also meet with the team members who complained about Daniel to start a dialogue about their own behaviour. I use this situation as an opportunity to coach these team members on how to act more constructively should they experience problems with a colleagues' performance another time. They could have offered feedback directly to Daniel themselves before coming to me, and offered their help directly to Daniel on how he could improve his attention to detail.
