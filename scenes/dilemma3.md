 - Title: Dilemma 3: Disagreeing with a direct manager
 - Image: https://mikkelschou.github.io/demo/leadership_dilemma_3.jpg
 - Next: dilemma4
 
# Description
Two specialised members of your team are working on a project that has a deadline in two weeks. Vivian, your direct manager, asks you to put the project on hold because she needs the two team members to work on a new project, which has a higher priority. You worry about this decision. 

You decide to tell Vivian that delaying the current project could lead to serious challenges for a wide range of internal stakeholders who rely on the outputs of the project to be completed on time. You also worry how your two team members will react.

Vivian insists that the new project needs to start immediately.

What do you do?

# Choice
After talking to her, I can feel that I'm still worried about putting the current project on hold. I decide to call her for a follow-up talk where I explain my concerns and the consequences of her request, as I see it. I ask her to reconsider the decision, or at least postpone it by another two weeks until we are done with the current project.

# Feedback
Pushing back on your direct manager's decision can be healthy. However, in this case Vivian has made it clear that the shift needs to happen. You have full information about the importance of your current project, but she could have information about the importance of the new project. Consider asking Vivian for further clarification on the urgency of the new project instead of only stating your own concerns once more. You might delay critical work processes that are of higher priority to the business. 


This is a dilemma between demonstrating agility and adapting quickly to change, inspire and support others through times of change as well as delegating and empovering others to take action.


# Choice
I call for an emergency meeting with the two members of my team and let them know about Vivian's request. I tell them that I will get in touch with our internal stakeholders immediately and prepare them for the upcoming delay of our deliverables.

# Feedback
It's great that you're so quick to initiate the shift. However, you should also think about ways to involve your team members in this transition to ensure their engagement. For example, you could seek clarification on the urgency of the new project from Vivian so you are better able to explain to your team members why the shift is so important.

# Choice
 I tell Vivian that I would like to make the shift in priorities, but that I have some clarifying questions about the need to make the shift now. Once I understand why the shift is so important I'll be in a better position to motivate my team members to make it happen.

# Feedback
Great choice. When confusion arises it's important to seek clarification and speak your mind. By firstly telling Vivian that you're keen to make the shift, and then stating that you need more clarification, you make it clear that you are supportive of her decision.

# Choice
I call for a meeting with the two members of my team. I make sure to let them know that they are doing a good job. Then I tell them about the shift in priorities and explain that their time is more valuable to the new project. I ask them how they want to communicate the delay of our current deliverables to the stakeholders, and ask them to help me come up with a plan for the shift.

# Feedback
Good choice. Sometimes we have to come to terms with decisions that we don't necessarily agree with. Engaging your team members in the preparation of the shift is likely to empower them in a situation where they may easily feel out of control. You could consider seeking further clarification on the urgency of the new project from Vivian so you better can explain why the shift is so urgent.
