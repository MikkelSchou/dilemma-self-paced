# Description
You're in a meeting with Hanne, a trusted employee, who has been with your team for more than two years. 

In the meeting, Hanne brings up a situation three months ago where you didn't involve her in a decision regarding a work process that she is part of. She explains that she felt left out.

You know that Hanne has a big need to be involved. However, you sometimes get frustrated with too many meetings and too much talking. In this case, you also think that the decision was so minor that a meeting with Hanne wasn't really necessary.

How do you respond?




# Choice
I thank Hanne for bringing up the situation. I explain that I had made the decision quickly because I thought it was an insignificant change. I apologise that she felt left out of the process and ask her what we can do in the future to avoid these situations.

# Feedback
This is a very empathetic response towards Hanne. However, by not addressing your different working style preferences there's a risk that you'll become increasingly frustrated with Hanne's need for involvement over time. Consider talking more openly to Hanne about your different preferences and discuss ways to work together around these. 

This is a dilemma of being aware of and balancing own and others' thoughts and feelings, respecting the diversity in others and providing sincere feedback.




# Choice
I share with Hanne that we might have different working style preferences when it comes to being involved and engaging others in decisions about work processes. I ask Hanne what it means to her to be involved in a decision. Then I invite her to reflect on how we might avoid a similar situation in the future, while balancing both our working style preferences.

# Feedback
Excellent choice. It's great that you address your different working style preferences. Figuring out a way to work around these in the future will be important for ensuring a collaborative and high-performing team. Staying curious about what both of you can learn from the process also demonstrates a strong growth mind-set.

# Choice
After listening to Hanne, I acknowledge that it must have been a frustrating experience. However, I also explain that I don't involve others in a decision unless it's important as it can impact efficiency in the team. I tell Hanne that I need her to trust my ability to make these decisions, and I encourage her to bring up issues like these earlier so we can clear out any confusion sooner rather than later.

# Feedback
Consider inviting Hanne into a shared reflection on how your different working style preferences led to this situation, and identify ways to work around these in the future. Perhaps Hanne can learn how to better raise concerns with you, and perhaps you can learn how to better communicate decisions to your team.
