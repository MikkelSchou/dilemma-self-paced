# Description
You are leading a team that works in a controlled, not classified (CNC) area. This means that there is a standard which specifies how to gown.

You've just overheard some colleagues discuss that the procedure for gowning is not being followed. You don't know if it goes for your team.  
Today  it's Tuesday and on Friday you are going away on holiday.

What do you do?


# Choice
I revisit the gowning standard (SOP) together with one of my team members, to make sure I understand the procedure myself. Afterwards, I let the team know that I will process confirm the SOP. The following day I take time out to observe the gowning behaviours of my employees during peak hours before I decide on what actions to take.

# Feedback
This is a great choice. It underlines your thorough understanding of process confirmation and the value of to going where the problem may be to gather and process data first. It's great that you don't jump to conclusions when you hear of the possible non-compliance with standards in your team. 

This is a dilemma between taking the time to go out to see and understand how working processes are performing, building trust and ensuring an engaging working environment.




# Choice
It's important for me to solve this issue before I go on holiday. I take action by sending an email to my team to let them know that I will be process confirming the gowning SOP because it is not being followed. I then go to the changing area every day up until Friday to observe the gowning behaviours. If I observe anyone who doesn't follow the standard I advise them what they need to do differently.

# Feedback
It's great that you're responding so quickly to the news of possible non-compliance with standards in your team. However, be careful not to jump to conclusions maybe it wasn't your team members the colleagues were referring to. Letting your team know that you will be observing them in advance is the right thing to do. If you observe non-compliant behaviour, it's important you decide on more sustainable actions than just addressing the individual employee. It could be that your entire team needs to be retrained or maybe it's not the quality of the SOP that's the root cause if you discover non-compliant behaviour.

# Choice
I schedule a meeting with Louise, a trusted employee, to find out if there are any problems with following the gowning standard (SOP) in the team before I decide what actions to take.

# Variables

- rolemodel-driveoutcome-new-1_4: 0.4


# Feedback
It's a good idea to explore the issue in more detail instead of immediately assuming that your team members are not following the gowning standard. However, it's best to go out and openly process confirm if in fact the SOP is being followed or not instead of only talking to one team member.
